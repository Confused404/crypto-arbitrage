 (taker: you take liquidity from the order book)
 most arbitrage bots are 'takers' because you need speed not patience, 
 if you wait for a 'maker' order (another order type) 
 to get filled, the price gap can disappear

 ðŸ’° Why taker fees are critical in arbitrage
Letâ€™s say:
You see a $10 price gap between Binance and OKX.
You want to buy on one exchange and sell on the other.
But:
    Binance taker fee: 0.10%
    OKX taker fee: 0.10%
    Total fee round trip = 0.20%
On a $70,000 BTC, 0.20% = $140 in fees.
That means:
ðŸ‘‰ if the spread is less than $140, you donâ€™t make money, even if the prices look different.
ðŸ‘‰ only spreads larger than your fees are true opportunities. """

""" A pro arbitrageur would remind you:
Taker fees eat most spreads. 
Many apparent opportunities vanish once fees are applied.
Some exchanges offer lower fees (e.g., VIP accounts or rebates). 
Thatâ€™s why infrastructure and fee structure often matter more than spotting the gap itself. """

""" TOB = "Top of Book" 
    every crypto exchange maintains an order book -- basically a list of all:
    * Bids = what buyers are willing to pay (best is highest)
    * Asks = what sellers are asking for (best is lowest)
    So TOB is the best bid and the best ask 
    TOB is thought of as the "front door" of the market
    for small retail arbitrage TOB gives you the fastest and clearest signal
    *** Pro traders often subsrcibe to real time TOB streams (websockets) 
    *** to detect and react to microsecond price changes
"""

"""
    Tickers are:
        Lightweight: They donâ€™t require subscribing to the full order book.
        Fast: You can stream or poll them to track price movements in near real-time.
        Enough for many use cases: dashboards, alerts, price checks, etc.

    For arbitrage bots, theyâ€™re often used as the first stage to:
        Detect spread opportunities between exchanges,
        Decide when to pull more detailed data (e.g., full order book),
        Estimate potential profitability quickly.
